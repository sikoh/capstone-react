      <p>
        I've been programming every day for the past 6 months. On the days that
        I'm not able to directly write code, I read books and watch courses or
        youtube videos. I don't keep track, but I believe I've watched hundreds
        of videos about coding. I consider myself a shameless cloner - I try to
        learn from everyone. I write down everything that makes sense to me and
        could potentially benefit me and increase my productivity. My view has
        been - I don't have enough time to figure out a lot of these things on
        my own, so I've decided to abandon my ego and try to learn as much from
        others as possible.
      </p>
